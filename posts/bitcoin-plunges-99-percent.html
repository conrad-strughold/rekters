            <div class="article-content"><p>LONDON (Rekters) - In a shocking turn of events that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has plummeted to just $1 after Satoshi Nakamoto's cat reportedly sold all of its holdings.</p><p>The feline, known only as "Whiskers," allegedly gained access to the private keys of the original Bitcoin wallet and executed a massive sell order early this morning. Market analysts are calling this the "Great Cat-astrophe of 2024."</p><p>"This is unprecedented," said Dr. Sarah Smith, a leading crypto analyst. "We've seen market crashes before, but never one orchestrated by a cat. The fact that it managed to access the private keys is particularly concerning."</p><p>In related news, Dogecoin has surged 1000% as investors flock to the "good boy" cryptocurrency. Elon Musk has yet to tweet about the situation, but sources close to the billionaire say he's currently teaching his dog to trade.</p><p>As the crypto market reels from this unprecedented event, one question remains on everyone's mind: Who let the cat out of the wallet?</p></div>
